Miners have the ability to manipulate block.timestamp so it can be exploited if there is an incentive to do so. There are some restrictions on how miners can change block.timestamp: It has to be greater than the last parent block and it can not be too far in the future otherwise other nodes will reject it.

Let's look at the example provided at https://github.com/sigp/solidity-security-blog#12-block-timestamp-manipulation-1

The miner can manipulate "now" (an alias for block.timestamp) and inject a transaction of their own so "if(now % 15 == 0)" evaluates to true and they can take all the Ether.
