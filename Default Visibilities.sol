Earlier version of solidity did not enforce defining visibility on functions. This created situations where an attacker would be able to call a function that he/she should't be. Recent Solidity versions enforce setting up visibility on every function so this vulnerability has been mitigated. However it is still important to review the visibilities of all functions to eliminate any misuse by malicious users.
